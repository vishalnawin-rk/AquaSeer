### Overview
AquaSeer is designed to address the challenges of managing water resources and controlling floods in reservoirs. By integrating optimized strategies, it aims to accurately estimate reservoir inflows, optimize water release, and enhance flood resilience. With a holistic approach, the system balances water resource sustainability, ecological health, and flood prevention, ensuring a long-term positive impact on the basin’s communities and environment.

### Features
- **Precise Inflow Estimation**: Accurate calculation of inflow rates into reservoirs using data on soil moisture, precipitation patterns, and other variables.
- **Automated Gate Operations**: Streamlines reservoir gate operations to regulate water release, ensuring both flood prevention and reservoir capacity management.
- **Proactive Flood Mitigation**: Reduces flood risks by automating gate operations and optimizing water release during periods of increased inflow.
- **Alarm System for Early Warnings**: Immediate communication with reservoir controllers during fluctuations in water levels to ensure swift action.
- **Sustainable Water Management**: Promotes sustainable water use, guaranteeing availability for various purposes while maintaining ecological balance.

### Components Used
- **Arduino UNO**: Microcontroller to manage sensor inputs and control systems.
- **MG995 Servo Motor**: Controls the opening and closing of reservoir gates.
- **SIM800L GSM Module**: Enables communication for alert notifications via SMS.
- **Ultrasonic Sensor**: Measures water levels in reservoirs.
- **Soil Moisture Sensor**: Detects soil moisture levels to estimate potential inflow.
- **Rain Sensor**: Monitors precipitation to assess inflow from rainfall.
- **Flow Sensor**: Measures the flow of water through gates or channels.
- **ThingSpeak**: Platform for real-time data visualization and monitoring.

### System Architecture
1. **Data Collection**: Sensors gather real-time data on soil moisture, precipitation, and reservoir water levels.
2. **Inflow Estimation**: Advanced algorithms calculate inflow rates based on collected data to predict water volumes entering the reservoirs.
3. **Automated Gate Control**: The system automatically adjusts reservoir gates to manage water flow, preventing flooding while retaining capacity for future needs.
4. **Alarm Notification**: In case of gate operation (opening or closing), the respective authority receives an SMS message before and after the action is executed.
5. **Visualization Platform**: Data is visualized on the ThingSpeak platform for easy access and real-time monitoring by reservoir managers.

### How It Works
1. **Data Monitoring**: Soil moisture, rainfall, and reservoir levels are constantly monitored using sensors.
2. **Inflow Calculation**: Based on real-time data, the system calculates inflow into the reservoirs.
3. **Automated Response**: If inflows exceed set thresholds, the system triggers gate operations to release water and prevent flooding.
4. **Alarm Notification**: Before and after each gate operation (opening or closing), an SMS message is sent to the relevant authority, ensuring they are informed of all actions.
5. **Sustainable Management**: Continuous monitoring ensures that water release is optimized for sustainability and ecological balance.

### Installation and Usage
1. **Hardware Setup**:
   - Connect soil moisture sensors, rain sensors, ultrasonic sensors, and flow sensors to the Arduino UNO following the device datasheets.
   - Set up MG995 servo motors to automate the control of reservoir gates.
   - Establish GSM connectivity using the SIM800L module for alert notifications.
2. **Software Setup**:
   - Program the Arduino UNO with algorithms for inflow estimation and gate control.
   - Set up ThingSpeak for data visualization and cloud-based monitoring.
3. **Real-Time Monitoring**:
   - Track inflow rates, reservoir water levels, and gate operations on the ThingSpeak dashboard.

### Future Enhancements
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Incorporate machine learning to predict inflow trends and enhance flood risk mitigation.
- **Community Notification System**: Implement alerts for local communities to prepare for potential flooding events.
- **Water Conservation Strategies**: Extend the project to optimize water conservation efforts in times of drought or low rainfall.
